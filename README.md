## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images. 
## How to navigate this project
- App can be accessed through the index.html file.
- More JavaScript DOM manipulation.
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, but this project focused on the
  frontend, specifically DOM manipulation 
## If I had more time I would change this
- Refactor some of the code, especially this part (line 246-273): [https://github.com/seankozen/FSJS-techdegree-project-3/blob/main/js/script.js]
